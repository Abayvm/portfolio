                    when you young. you happy always.<br/>
                    shiny new toy = happy,<br/>
                    candy = happy<br/>
                    but now you happy always? maybe not. why?<br/><br/>

                    If ancient human happy always, no weapons, no fire, no wheel, no pyramid and no development!
                    just "Aha.. nice weather.. lets just chill".<br/><br/>

                    Imagine them:<br/>
                    Caveman 1: "We make thing?"<br/>
                    Caveman 2: "Nah... sky nice. Why make?"<br/>
                    Caveman 1: "Fire good, maybe?"<br/>
                    Caveman 2: "Pfft. Fire hot. No need. Sit, look cloud."<br/>
                    Caveman 1: "Cloud pretty. We smart."<br/>
                    Caveman 2: "Yes, we no need fire. We fine."<br/><br/>

                    No progress, no inventions.<br/>
                    No stress, no survival instincts. Just vibes.<br/>
                    But then... nothing develops. Weâ€™re all still in caves, enjoying good vibes only, staring at clouds like, "Yeah, this is peak human achievement."<br/>
                    Maybe brain for not always happy.<br/><br/>

                    If we happy always, we still be cavemen with no progress, no music, no art, no instagram to scroll.<br/><br/>

                    stress good for progress.
